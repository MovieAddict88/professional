### System Notes

* Use **plain PHP + MySQLi** (no heavy frameworks for InfinityFree).
* Use `config.php` for DB connection and `setup.php` for database initialization.
* Use Bootstrap (CDN) for UI.
* Store uploaded images in `/uploads/` and save only file paths in DB.
* Optimize for InfinityFree limitations:

  * Avoid large files or heavy libraries.
  * Keep database schema minimal.

---

### Database Tables (Minimum)

* `teachers` (id, teacher\_id, fullname, grade\_levels, avatar, password)
* `students` (id, student\_id, fullname, grade\_level)
* `attendance` (id, student\_id, date, status)
* `quizzes` (id, title, subject, date, grade\_level)
* `quiz_scores` (id, student\_id, quiz\_id, score)
* `achievements` (id, student\_id, title, description, date)

---

### Future Expansion

* Add **REST API endpoints** for Android app integration.
* Generate **PDF/Excel reports** for attendance, quizzes, and achievements.
* Add **parent notifications** (email or mobile app push).
